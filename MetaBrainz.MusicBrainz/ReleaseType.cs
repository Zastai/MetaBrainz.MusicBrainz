  /// (an LP or "Long Play") and the tracks are usually exclusive to the EP, in other words the tracks don't come from a previously issued release. EP is fairly

  /// <item><description>
  /// In the US market, a single typically has one main song and possibly a handful of additional tracks or remixes of the main track; the single is usually named after
  /// its main song; the single is primarily released to get radio play and to promote release sales.
  /// </description></item>
  /// <item><description>
  /// The U.K. market (also Australia and Europe) is similar to the US market, however singles are often released as a two disc set, with each disc sold separately.
  /// They also sometimes have a longer version of the single (often combining the tracks from the two disc version) which is very similar to the US style single, and
  /// this is referred to as a "maxi-single". (In some cases the maxi-single is longer than the release the single comes from!)
  /// </description></item>
  /// <item><description>
  /// The Japanese market is much more single driven. The defining factor is typically the length of the single and the price it is sold at. Up until 1995 it was common
  /// that these singles would be released using a mini-cd format, which is basically a much smaller CD typically 8 cm in diameter. Around 1995 the 8cm single was phased
  /// out, and the standard 12cm CD single is more common now; generally re-releases of singles from pre-1995 will be released on the 12cm format, even if they were
  /// originally released on the 8cm format. Japanese singles often come with instrumental versions of the songs and also have maxi-singles like the UK with remixed
  /// versions of the songs. Sometimes a maxi-single will have more tracks than an EP but as it's all alternate versions of the same 2-3 songs it is still classified
  /// as a single.
  /// </description></item>
  /// </list>
  /// There are other variations of the single called a "split single" where songs by two different artists are released on the one disc, typically vinyl. The term
  /// "B-Side" comes from the era when singles were released on 7 inch (or sometimes 12 inch) vinyl with a song on each side, and so side A is the track that the single
  /// is named for, and the other side -side B- would contain a bonus song, or sometimes even the same song.
